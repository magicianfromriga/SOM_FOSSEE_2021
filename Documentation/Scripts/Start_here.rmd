The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce students, professionals and researchers to the topic of Self Organizing Maps, a type of artificial neural network used for dimensionality reduction. This tutorial is designed for students of all ages and fields, without any prerequisites, however a fundamental understanding of neural networks is recommended. For understanding the basics of R programming you may refer to the spoken tutorial on R [here](https://spoken-tutorial.org/tutorial-search/?search_foss=R&search_language=English).
This tutorial is divided into 3 modules, which will introduce the subject in an incremental manner. You may utilize the modules in any order, depending on your pace.
